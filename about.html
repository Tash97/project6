                Hi, I'm tash. I was born and raised in a small town on the gulf coast of Florida. Two years ago I decided it was time for a change and moved to the Orlando area, where my main profession is currently driving for Uber.

                    My father was a musician, so I was introduced to music relatively early and it has been accesible to me my entire life. I started playing saxophone in my school band around 12, then learned guitar shortly after. In my late teens I started teaching myself music theory, which progressed into me learning a total of 5 instruments: guitar, bass, piano, saxophone, and ukelele.

                I've been an avid gamer my entire life. I prefer open world survival games like Ark and Minecraft, but I enjoy most games and have played most major titles.

                I currently work full-time as an uber driver and have for the past year and a half. I generally enjoy the work, as well as getting to meet new people and hear peoples experiences. The job has helped me to branch out and start my life in a new environment.

                As you can tell from reading this; I am also an aspiring developer. my journey with coding started 5 years ago with an app that helped teach me the basics of javascript, and progressed into me aquiring a basic understanding of both front and back end development. Now I'm attending this coding bootcamp to gain professional certification and start my career in tech!
